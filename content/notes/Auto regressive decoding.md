 **Auto-regressive decoding** is fundamental in LLM inference for generating coherent and con- textually appropriate text. It ensures that each token generated is conditioned on a comprehensive understanding of all previously generated content, allowing LLMs to produce highly relevant and fluent text sequences.

Here, $P(y|X_{t-1})$ represents the probability of the next token ùë¶ given the current sequence $X_{t-1}$, and $\oplus$ denotes the concatenation operation. The $argmax$ function is used to select the most probable next token at each step.
